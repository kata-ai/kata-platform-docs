# Introduction

Qios is a chat-based commerce platform. For business owners, it sounds familiar to handle transactions through chat and what comes next is when their team canâ€™t handle it well due to too many order chats coming in a day. Qios comes to help businesses handling their day-to-day transactions using chatbot. With Qios, you will get the end-to-end experience, from serving customers through chat bot to managing store, inventory and order through our own merchant dashboard. To make it more one stop solution, you will not only get the dashboard to handle transactions but you will also get the integration with our customer service dashboard, Kata Omnichat.
