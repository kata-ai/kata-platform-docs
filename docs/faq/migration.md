## I had multiple Bots and NLs on previous version, where is it now?

We have migrated all of your Bots and NLs to different projects. For example, if you have 5 Bots and 3 NLs, now you should have 8 different projects

## My bot has a lot of Versions, what about now?

It still goes by the name of Versions. But the new Versions may require you to specify Bot, NL and CMS Revisions

## Also, where's my Deployment and Channel now?

For those of you who have created *a lot of deployments and channels, *we will migrate this to Environments. So you should have multiple Environments, based on your Deployments. For example, previously you had 2 Deployments, on the new version you should have 5 Environments which consist of: the old 2 and the new 3 default Environments (Development, Staging, and Production)

## Can I use different NL from different Project?

Yes, you still can use this as usual

## Can I build NL on a migrated Project?

Yes, you should be able to build your own NL and CMS under a migrated Project. Should something goes wrong, feel free to reach out to us at support@kata.ai

## In case of any questions or issues, to whom should I talk to?

Please contact us at support@kata.ai
