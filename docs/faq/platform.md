You can invite anyone to access your CMS Client under User menu on CMS Studio. Bear in mind for now, you can only invite user that is already registered on Kata Platform. This will change soon, stay tune for update.

### Can I Rollback to previous Version?

## Migration

### I had multiple Bots and NLs on previous version, where is it now?

We have migrated all of your Bots and NLs to different projects. For example, if you have 5 Bots and 3 NLs, now you should have 8 different projects

### My bot has a lot of Versions, what about now?

It still goes by the name of Versions. But the new Versions may require you to specify Bot, NL and CMS Revisions

### Also, where's my Deployment and Channel now?

For those of you who have created *a lot of deployments and channels, *we will migrate this to Environments. So you should have multiple Environments, based on your Deployments. For example, previously you had 2 Deployments, on the new version you should have 5 Environments which consist of: the old 2 and the new 3 default Environments (Development, Staging, and Production)
