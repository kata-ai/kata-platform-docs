Slack is where work flows. It's where the people you need, the information you share, and the tools you use come together to get things done. In this section, we will learn to connect our bot with Telegram. You can use the bot you created in the [Hello World tutorial](/tutorial/hello-world/) to start integrating your bot with Telegram.

## Create Slack Channel

First thing first, you need to [sign in](https://slack.com/signin) into your Slack Team to create a new
app and get its token.
After logged in, open this [URL:](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps).

1. Click "Start here" then "Create a Slack app".

## Setup Webhook URL in Slack Bot

Once finished, you will see the newly-created channel in the list. You will also see a Webhook URL for your channel. This webhook URL will be added to the Slack bot. Copy the webhook URL by clicking "View Channel" and clicking the copy button next to the Webhook URL field.
