Qiscus is an AI compliant, secure and flexible chat SDK for apps and websites. They also provide multichannel customer service chat solution which is now getting popular as it is best designed for everyone to enhance their customer service experiences using multiple channels and bot-human collaboration customer service. In this section, we will learn on how to connect our bot with Qiscus thorough these following steps.

## Create Qiscus Channel

1. First thing first, you need to register yourself at [Qiscus Multichannel CS Chat Website](https://multichannel.qiscus.com) to create a new app. You will be asked to fill in several information regarding your account.

3. After you verified your account, you can log into the Qiscus Multichannel CS Chat dashboard via [login page](https://multichannel.qiscus.com). Please fill in your credentials to get into the dashboard.

4. Once you logged in, go to the integration page, and enable the "Qiscus Widget" tab like shown on picture below.

5. Copy the snippet code shown on the page and paste it into your _**website html**_. You can open your html later after you integrate the bot.

6. As predicted, the next step is you need to integrate the bot by enabling the "Bot Integration" in the Integration Page. You will also see Agent ID, App ID, Qiscus Secret Key, URL. These four things will be needed later in defining a new channel in Kata Platform. There's also one blank space in "Bot Webhook URL" which can be filled later after creating the channel in Kata Platform.
