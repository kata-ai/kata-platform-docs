## **FAQ Table**

Use this table to maintain FAQ-related knowledge of your bot. Since we have implemented our own Natural Language Model, specifically for FAQ-related contents to this FAQ Table, you don't need to do extra training on NL Studio.

You can create as many **labels** as you like, depending on how many topics you would like to handle under this FAQ. Every **question** will be considered as training data and will enrich the existing Natural Language Model, so the more the merrier. You can also put more than one **answers** as variations to avoid any repetitive responses.
