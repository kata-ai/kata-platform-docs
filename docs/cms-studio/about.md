CMS Studio allows you to build a custom workspace where everyone in your team can collaborate in modifying all bot contents, from editing bot responses to creating new bot features, without writing a single line of code or deploying anything.

Every dashboard will have its own namespace that you can define under Deploy - Environment Menu.

### About Page, Form, and Element

Before you start building your workspace, you need to understand these components:

- **Page** is the main category (i.e. Product Page)
- **Form** is a sub-category inside a Page (i.e Product X Response Form)
- **Element** is a unit inside a Form. (i.e. editable contents about Product X)

Currently, we don't set any limit to how many pages, forms, or elements you can build under one CMS, so you can build it as many as you want. However, please note that Kata Dashboard will be used by your clients, so it's better to make it as simple as possible.
