Kata Command Line Interface (Kata CLI) is a tool for creating bots with Kata Markup Language (Kata ML) and helps managing the bots with command line/shell of various operating systems.
For more information, check our website ([http://kata.ai/en](http://kata.ai/en)).

## Installation

To install Kata-CLI in global mode, run this command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g kata-cli
```

This is the preferred method to install Kata-CLI, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

## Upgrading to 2.0

We upgraded Kata-CLI version into 2.0 along with our Platform to 3.0. There are a number of small backwards incompatible changes with version 2.0. See the full descriptions [here](https://github.com/kata-ai/kata-cli/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md). **Make sure to update Kata-CLI to our latest stable version before doing some fun with your Bot**.

```shell
// check kata-cli current version
➜  kata --version
   Kata CLI version 1.2.3
```

```shell
// upgrade kata-cli to the latest version
➜  npm i -g Kata-CLI
```

or to be exact, you can add `@version-number`

```shell 
➜  npm i -g Kata-CLI@2.x.x
```

Then, check kata-cli upgraded version.

```shell
➜  kata --version
   Kata CLI version 2.0.4
```

In Kata-CLI 2.0, we introduce Project Environment on the top of the Bots, NLU and CMS. Hence, before running Kata-CLI main command, such as: `kata init`,`kata push`, `kata console`, etc., user have to define the Project that they are working on using this command. 

```
➜  kata select-project
```
