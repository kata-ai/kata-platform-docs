Kata Command Line Interface (Kata CLI) is a tool for creating bots with Kata Markup Language (Kata ML) and helps managing the bots with command line/shell of various operating systems.
For more information, check our website ([http://kata.ai/en](http://kata.ai/en)).

Soon, we will implement Kata-CLI 2.0 because of our updated platform to 3.0. In Kata-CLI 2.0, we introduce Project Environment on the top of the Bots. Hence, before running Kata-CLI main command, such as: `kata init`,`kata push`, `kata console`, etc., user have to define the Project that they are working on.

## Installation

To install Kata-CLI in global mode, run this command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g Kata-CLI
```

This is the preferred method to install Kata-CLI, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
