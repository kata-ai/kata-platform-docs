An NLU must be under a project. Therefore, we need to define a project, before we create an NLU.

## NLU Project Best Practice

### Initialize NLU Project

It would create a new file `nlu.yml` in which the nlu structure can be defined.

```shell
# initialize a nlu project
➜  kata nl-init
```

### Push NLU

To use push command to create and update the NLU

```shell
# push current nlu project
➜  kata nl-push
```

### List Profiles

To list all profiles

```shell
➜  kata list-profiles
```

### Train NLU

To train a nlu.

```shell
➜  kata nl-train [-f <trainPath/filename.txt>]
➜  kata nl-train [-s <sentence>]
```

### Predict Sentences with NLU

```
➜  kata nl-predict [-f <trainPath/filename.txt>]
➜  kata nl-predict [-s <sentence>]
```
