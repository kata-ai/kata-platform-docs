## What's New

### Project System

Manage your chatbot project under one roof. A project consists of one bot design, one NL, and one CMS. Each of them will have different versions you can maintain.

### CMS Studio

Build your own CMS for your chatbot. Your client will have a full access to maintain the knowledge or content of your chatbot. Now you can build your own CMS based on your needs.

Once you've done building your own dashboard, you can invite users or clients to contribute to the dashboard and update your bot's knowledge easily. All in all, your dashboard will look like this:
