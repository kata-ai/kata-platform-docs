## What's New

### Project System

Manage your chatbot project under one roof. A project consists of one bot design, one NL, and one CMS. Each of them will have different versions you can maintain.

Once you've done building your own dashboard, you can invite users or clients to contribute to the dashboard and update your bot's knowledge easily. All in all, your dashboard will look like this:
