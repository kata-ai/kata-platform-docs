## What is Chatbot

What truly differentiate bot and traditional application is the statefulness: a bot usually keep track of the context of the conversation as messages without context are normally meaningless.

In Kata Bot Platform, the processing of user message is divided into three pipelined steps:

1.  Intent Recognition Converting raw message into structured information (in form of intent and attributes)
2.  State Mapping Determining the state of the bot and the context variables
3.  Choosing Action Generate response by executing defined action
