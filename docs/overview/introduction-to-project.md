### About Project

Project system is introduced to keep things more organized and to avoid clutter by putting everything you need in one place. A project contains one bot design, one NL, and one CMS.

### About Revision List

Revision Lists records a hash number every time you publish your bot design, NL, or CMS. You can also see people who published the revision along with the changelog.

### About Deployment

Project deployment on Kata | Platform 3.0 will refer to the latest revision of bot, NL, and CMS. You can also restore an earlier version of a deployment using 'Rollback' feature.

### About Environment

To help you ensure only high quality and robust bots are delivered to your users, now Kata | Platform 3.0 allows you to set up 3 separate environments in your project: Development, Staging, and Production.
