To send messages to your audiences, you have to use Broadcast credit. In your dashboard you will see a credit template message balance, one (1) credit represents one (1) template message sent to your client. Cost per template message credit is determined by the different volume of credits you purchased (self-payment) or commercial agreement (for enterprise).

You can see the remaining broadcast credit of a phone number connected to your business dashboard on the **Whatsapp Numbers** page. You can also top up broadcast credits from the business dashboard.
