### Activate/Deactivate Custom Agents Allocation (Admin & Supervisor)

Kata Omnichat allocates available agents by automatically assign less busier agent to a new created chat group. However, you may want to customise this rule by making your own rule. In order to do so, you need to create a webhook that manage how your agents in Kata Omnichat is assigned.

![./img/omnichat/allocation](Custom Agents allocation illustration)

To connect your webhook with Kata Omnichat, you just have to enable custom agent allocation feature in Settings page in Kata Omnichat by switching on the toggle button on the top-right of the page and provide the webhook URL in the field provided as depicted in image below. By doing so, Kata Omnichat will no longer enforce automatic rule in agent allocation for you. So you are free to do it your own way.

Kata Omnichat will hit your webhook with this payload that you could use in managing agent allocation.

```json
{
  "app_id": "oni-xxxxxxxxx",
  "source": "qiscus",
  "email": "randompertama@mail.com",
  "avatar_url": "https:\/\/d1edrlpyc25xu0.cloudfront.net\/kiwari-prod\/image\/upload\/75r6s_jOHa\/1507541871-avatar-mine.png",
  "extras": "{\"a\":\"s\"}",
  "room_id": "123456"
}
```

In your webhook, it's up to you on how you will assign a newly connected user with your agents. What you will need to do however, is to hit our **Assign agent to room id** API when you do agent assignments. So for example, if you have a chat with doctor service, you may want to assign your users based on their selected doctors (agents).
Below are a couple of additional documentation and an example on how you could use custom agent allocation.

2. [An example of how custom agent allocation has been done](https://bitbucket.org/qiscus/qismo-salesforce-crm-sample/src/). You need to have Salesforce account to try this example.
